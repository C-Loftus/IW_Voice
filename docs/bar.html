<p>Voice assistant</p>
<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>This project is a general purpose voice assistant program for Linux  designed for  helping people with disabilities or hand injuries.  It seeks to be easily customizable  and functionally robust. It can control  windows, execute commands defined in the config.yaml  file,  automatically type spoken input, execute shell commands,  or serve as an orchestrator between other application specific voice control programs.</p>
<p>There are four modes for the application.
 #### command mode
 command mode executes commands  defined in the config file or  window control actions ( minimizing, maximizing, open in, closing, focusing). </p>
<p>#### shell mode
 Shell mode executes user input as a shell command. shell commands aresourced from the config file of the default shell. Therefore, aliases and functions can both be called from shell model with natural language names that the user can define. </p>
<p>This functionality allows the power and flexibility of the shell in conjunction with natural language commands the user can define</p>
<p>#### Dictation mode
  dictation mode executes all input as natural speech to text. </p>
