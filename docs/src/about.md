# About
Starling is a general purpose voice control program for Linux. It was especially created with the goal of helping people with disabilities or hand injuries.  It seeks to be easily customizable  and functionally robust. It can control  windows, execute commands defined in the config.yaml  file,  automatically type spoken input through speech-to-text, execute shell commands,  or serve as a general-purpose orchestrator between other application-specific voice control programs.

All speech recognition is done locally on your own device. No cloud APIs are used and there is no third-party interaction with your data whatsoever.

##  Development Background
 This project was the result of my junior year independent work at Princeton University.

The goal of this project has been to try and reimagine voice control.  For many disabled users, voice control appears to be a second rate solution.  It is seen as something of a necessary crutch to participate in otherwise  difficult activities.

 By leveraging the power of the system shell  and  user customization, I wanted to make it so that voice control could  navigate the system with fewer commands  and more natural  input.
