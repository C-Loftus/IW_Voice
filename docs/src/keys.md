## Raw Keyboard Input
Raw input from the keyboard is the easiest way to control your computer with Starling. Simply say the name of the keys that you wish to press.

You can press any keyboard combination by saying the name of a key. Since many of the letters  of the alphabet are very similar, Starling defines an alphabet in the config file. For instance 
`super cap` will  be decoded as a press of super and c at the same time. 
 the following is the alphabet as it is defined in the default config file, config.toml in the Starling project root directory.
 You can change any of these key value pairs to a different word if you  prefer the use of other words.


```yaml
alphabet: 
  - air       : "a" 
  - bat       : "b" 
  - cap       : "c" 
  - drum      : "d" 
  - each      : "e"
